# Terpsitone  
*An open-source reconstruction of Theremin‚Äôs forgotten performance instrument.*

## Overview  

**Terpsitone** is a modern reimagining of L√©on Theremin‚Äôs lost gesture-controlled instrument.  
This project combines **infrared motion sensing**, **TouchDesigner** for real-time tracking, and **Max/MSP** for dynamic sound synthesis.
